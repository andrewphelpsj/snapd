summary: Check that we can remove core snap on classic systems.

details: |
    This test checks that we can remove core snap on classic systems. Classic
    systems do not have 'base' set in their model. On UC systems, that would be
    interpreted as 'core' being the base. On classic (non-hybrid) systems, that
    should be interpreted as there not being a base required.

# we just need a single system to verify this
systems: [ubuntu-22.04-64]

    snap install core
