summary: Test running component install, pre-refresh, post-refresh, and remove hooks.

details: |
  Tests a snap operations on a snap with two components. Some arbitrary
  auto-connect plugs are picked for the components so that we can test that
  plugs are properly connected.

  The first component explicitly defines hooks that have the network-bind plug.
  These plugs succeed only if they are able to bind to the network. The second
  component contains implicit hooks that only receive the network plug. These
  hooks succeed only if they are able create a network connection.

  All of the hooks set variables that we use to verify that they are run.

systems: [ubuntu-16.04-64, ubuntu-18.04-64, ubuntu-2*, ubuntu-core-*]

prepare: |
  # the hooks in this test access /etc/mdns.allow to verify that the network
  # plug is connected. this is a simple way to check that the plug is connected
  # without actually using the network, which can be problematic in tests run
  # behind a proxy.
