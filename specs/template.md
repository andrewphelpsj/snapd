# Abstract
Short description of the issue being addressed. Limit this to a couple of
sentences.

# Rationale
Reasons why the specification should be accepted. It should explain why the
existing state, if any, is inadequate to address the issue being handled. If
possible, use cases should be included to help define and explain the goal.

Omit that section (rather than presenting silly reasoning) if there's no good
motivation for the specification, or if it is completely obvious. Note that lack
of motivation is a good reason to reject specifications.

# Specification
The specification should describe in detail the issue being addressed, and the
proposed way to handle it, covering the areas involving the issue, and allow
implementing the feature. It should NOT be an extensive "whitepaper" that is
supposed to make sense even to someone not aware of the major context the issue
is part of.

Use of subtopics is encouraged to structure the specification. This section
could include diagrams, code samples (formatted using the code blocks addon),
pseudo-code, tables, etc.

Open issues should be stated, and solved before the specification is approved.

Aim to keep the spec as brief as possible while getting the point across. There
is no minimum length for a spec.

# Further Information
That section, if present, may describe why particular design decisions were
made, alternate designs that were considered, and related work (e.g. how the
issue is handled in other systems).

May also include links to other (related) specs, links to version control repos,
links to Jira items spawned as a consequence or requirement of the specification
or external information.
